# Executed Poetry

Executed Poetry is a device that runs code-poems and displays their fleeting traces.

When the button is pressed, a short poem written in Python is executed inside the microcontroller. On the e-paper display, the executed poem appears together with its execution count, processing time, and the microcontroller’s unique public key and signature. These serve as cryptographic proof that the poem was indeed executed on that machine.

The included poems use Python’s primitive features to explore philosophical themes such as existence, eternity, and nothingness. One poem begins an infinite loop only to end it instantly; another defines and deletes a class that never truly exists; yet another returns itself while simultaneously negating itself. In just a few lines, the code oscillates on the boundary between computation and philosophy.

This work proposes a new relationship between computers and poetry. Poems are no longer merely read—they are executed. What we witness are the traces of execution, the epitaphs engraved by the machine itself.
